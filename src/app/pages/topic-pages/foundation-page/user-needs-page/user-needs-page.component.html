  <h1> Start with user needs </h1>
  <h4> <strong>Real user needs should inform product decisions.</strong> Whether our audience includes members of the public or government employees,
    decision-makers must include real people in our design process from the beginning. Then, we need to test the assumptions
    we make and the products and services we build with real people, to keep us focused on what is most useful and important.</h4>

        <h3>Key considerations</h3>
        <div class="text-image-container">
          <ul>
            <li>Does your product or service have access to the resources necessary to perform research?</li>
            <li>Who is your primary audience?</li>
            <li>What user needs will this product or service address?</li>
            <li>Do you use personas or other audience segment analysis techniques to connect your solutions to different segments of your audience?</li>
            <li>How often are you testing with real people?</li>
            <li>Which people will have the most difficulty with the product or service?</li>
            <li>Which research methods were used?</li>
            <li>What were the key findings?</li>
            <li>How and where were the findings documented?</li>

      <h3>Practical Actions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Start early.</strong> Early in the project, spend time with current and prospective users to better understand their perspective and the context of the problem.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a range of methods.</strong> Use a range of qualitative and quantitative research methods (such as 18F Methods) to determine people’s goals, needs, and behaviors.</li>
        <li><strong>Use prototypes.</strong> Use prototypes to test your assumptions and solutions with real people, in the field if possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Share your findings.</strong> Document and share your research findings with team members, managers, and the public, when practical.</li>
        <li><strong>Test regularly.</strong> As the product is being built, regularly test it with potential users to ensure it meets people’s needs.</li>
