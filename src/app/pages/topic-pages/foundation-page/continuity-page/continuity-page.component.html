  <h1> Promote continuity </h1>
  <h4><strong>Minimize disruption and provide a consistent experience: throughout services, over time, and across agencies, platforms, and devices.</strong>
    Consistency is not necessarily conformity. Agencies, sites, and services may have different audiences, missions, and goals —
    and the way we implement our solutions may differ — but we promote continuity by starting from shared solutions and values.
    These design principles are one set of shared values, and the design language of the U.S. Web Design System is another.
    Strive to build user-centered solutions that address the whole experience, not just a user’s specific task, but the context of
    their journey.</h4>

      <h3>Key considerations</h3>
      <div class="text-image-container">
        <ul>
          <li>Do you know if your audience understands the purpose of each page or section?</li>
          <li>Is it always clear what users are expected to do next?</li>
          <li>Have you tried and tested <strong>shared solutions</strong> before developing your own?</li>
          <li>Does your site or service have a consistent experience on any device or browser?</li>
          <li>Have you identified your highest-impact customer or user journeys? Within these journeys, have you identified specific
             opportunities at which to collect feedback?</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Practical Actions</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Identify yourself. </strong> Clearly identify your site as a federal government site.</li>
              <li><strong>Review your content. </strong> Review your content at least twice per year to assure information is correct and non-redundant.</li>
              <li><strong>Identify link rot.</strong> Find and fix broken links on your website.</li>
              <li><strong>Keep communications simple. </strong>  Ensure content is easy, personal, and timely.</li>
              <li><strong>Write for the web. </strong>  Expect users to skim and scan.</li>
              <li><strong>Understand expectations.  </strong> Understand what your audience expects of your service, and validate the success of your service with real users.</li>
              <li><strong>Work in the open.  </strong> When appropriate, share your development process and progress publicly.</li>
            </ul>
