  <h1> Promote continuity </h1>
  <h4><strong>Minimize disruption and provide a consistent experience: throughout services, over time, and across agencies, platforms, and devices.</strong>
    Consistency is not necessarily conformity. Agencies, sites, and services may have different audiences, missions, and goals —
    and the way we implement our solutions may differ — but we promote continuity by starting from shared solutions and values.
    These design principles are one set of shared values, and the design language of the U.S. Web Design System is another.
    Strive to build user-centered solutions that address the whole experience, not just a user’s specific task, but the context of
    their journey.</h4>
