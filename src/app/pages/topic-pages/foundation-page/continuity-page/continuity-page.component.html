        <h1> Promote continuity </h1>
        <h4><strong>Minimize disruption and provide a consistent experience: throughout services, over time, and across
            agencies, platforms, and devices.</strong>
          Consistency is not necessarily conformity. Agencies, sites, and services may have different audiences,
          missions, and goals —
          and the way we implement our solutions may differ — but we promote continuity by starting from shared
          solutions and values.
          These design principles are one set of shared values, and the design language of the U.S. Web Design System is
          another.
          Strive to build user-centered solutions that address the whole experience, not just a user’s specific task,
          but the context of
          their journey.</h4>

          <h3>Key considerations</h3>
          <div class="text-image-container">
            <ul>
              <li>Do you know if your audience understands the purpose of each page or section?</li>
              <li>Is it always clear what users are expected to do next?</li>
              <li>Have you tried and tested <strong>shared solutions</strong> before developing your own?</li>
              <li>Does your site or service have a consistent experience on any device or browser?</li>
              <li>Have you identified your highest-impact customer or user journeys? Within these journeys, have you
                identified specific
                opportunities at which to collect feedback?</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>Practical Actions</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Use a style guide. </strong> Use a simple and flexible style guide for content and style
                    throughout a product or service. Know if existing guides already exist in your agency before
                    developing something new.</li>
                  <li><strong>Connect related services with a similar style. </strong>Use the style guide consistently
                    for related digital services.</li>
                  <li><strong>Move or remove content with care.</strong> Provide proper notice and forwarding when
                    content is moved or removed</li>
                  <li><strong>Clarify multi-step processes. </strong> Give users clear information about where they are
                    in each step of a process.</li>
                  <li><strong>Support multi-session processes. </strong> Provide users with a way to exit and return
                    later to complete a process.</li>
                  <li><strong>Find a community. </strong>Participate in cross-government communities of practice.</li>
                </ul>
