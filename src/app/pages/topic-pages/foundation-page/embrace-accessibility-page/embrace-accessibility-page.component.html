  <h1> Embrace accessibility </h1>
  <h4> <strong>Accessibility affects everybody, build it into every decision.</strong> Legal requirements are a critical, necessary starting point, but this is only the beginning.
    Accessibility is about real people who use our services — it’s usability for people who interact with products differently. Everyone who works on government
    websites has a role to play in making federal resources accessible and inclusive. Design generously and celebrate accessibility requirements as a set of design
    constraints that help us create a better product for all users.</h4>
