  <h1> Earn trust </h1>
  <h4> <strong>Trust has to be earned every time.</strong> Federal websites and digital services can’t assume it. Trust is about understanding
    and meeting or exceeding expectations, a process that can be established quickly and maintained over continued interactions,
    but is easily damaged. Be reliable, consistent, and honest. Reduce the impact of failure with solid design and engineering.
     Be a good steward of your audience’s data, resources, and time.</h4>
